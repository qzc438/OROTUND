# OROTUND: Ontology-based Platform for Effective Sharing and Reuse of Deep Learning Models
## Home Page
The home-page is the landing page and provides the user with different options to search for DL models from different aspects such as the application domain, performance metrics (including accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score), model type, sensor type, number of layers, layer type, core layer type and functional layer type. When a search returns multiple models, the UI presents and orders models based on their performance (i.e. accuracy, precision etc).
## DL Model Details Page
If the user clicks the view button in the index page, it will redirect to DL model details page. For each model, the user can review information such as the feature set, sensor data type and other trained DL models for the same application that produced different accuracy results (this is due to the fact that DL models have mechanisms to assign weight and with each training run with same data, a new model with different accuracy may be generated).
