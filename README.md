# OROTUND: Ontology-based Platform for Effective Sharing and Reuse of Deep Learning Models
## Home Page
The home-page is the landing page and provides the user with different options to search for DL models from different aspects such as the application domain, performance metrics (including accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score), model type, sensor type, number of layers, layer type, core layer type and functional layer type. when a search returns multiple models, the UI presents and orders models based on their performance (i.e. accuracy, precision etc).
